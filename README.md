# Game Engine and Esther

This repository is in its early days for some small game development. As the game progresses this will slowly move to a private workspace for obvious reasons. For now the main goal is bottom-up game development to learn all the main ideas (in a 2D setting) by developing a dedicated game engine.

## Learning Goals

This list is a work in progress and I'll add to this as I continue development.

- Application builds and packaging principles (CMake)
- C++ in general as well as other tools such as formatting and linting
- General codebase design for C++ and external library linking
- Game loop control and FPS management (unconstrained variable FPS)
