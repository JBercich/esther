# Game Development

In this repository I aim to create a game from the ground up (bar SDL2). The main focus will be a split project with a dedicated small-scale engine for 2D environments wrapping the majority of package-dependent interface demands from a game instance. Over time, I may move this project to a private workspace depending on the progress I can make in my spare time. 

## Learning Outcomes

Below are some of the major learning outcomes I've made along the way in this project. As a starting point, I had no experience in C++ or any large-scale C-like application so all the strings attached have been grand learning experiences.

- CMake for application building, package handling, and its other purposes.
- Doxygen for C-like documentation generation for large-scale projects.
- C++ OOP structures and class implementations of application logic.
- C++ memory differences from C (shared pointers and destructors).
- Game-loop logic such as variable FPS, VSYNC, and fixed-step updates (chrono).
