3. [PROJECT_CHECKLIST.md](./PROJECT_CHECKLIST.md) - Track progress

## 🎯 Your 8 Issues

These are the tasks to complete (see ISSUES.md for details):

1. ⚙️ **CMake + SDL3** - Set up build system
2. 🎨 **OpenGL Context** - Initialize graphics
3. 📝 **Logging** - Add spdlog (infrastructure already created!)
4. 🔄 **Game Loop** - Create main loop
5. ✨ **Shader System** - Compile and manage shaders
6. 📦 **Resources** - Load assets
7. 🎨 **Example Shaders** - Test rendering (partially done!)
8. 📚 **Documentation** - Capture learnings (partially done!)

## 💡 Key Features

### Learning Focused
Every issue includes 5-7 carefully selected learning resources:
- Official documentation
- Video tutorials
