# Milestone: SDL3 and OpenGL Game Engine Setup

## Description
Set up a complete CMake-based game development environment using SDL3 for window management and input handling, and modern OpenGL for graphics rendering with shader support. This milestone focuses on establishing the foundational infrastructure for C++ game development with comprehensive learning resources for developers new to these frameworks.

## Goals
- Configure CMake build system to manage SDL3, OpenGL, and logging dependencies
- Establish a basic game loop with window management and rendering
- Implement shader compilation and management system
- Set up comprehensive logging for development and debugging
- Create example shaders demonstrating basic rendering techniques
- Provide learning resources and documentation for each component

## Target Completion
This milestone should be completed incrementally, with each issue building upon the previous ones. Estimated time: 4-6 weeks for a developer new to C++/SDL3/OpenGL.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Project successfully builds with CMake on the target platform
- [ ] SDL3 window opens and displays OpenGL-rendered content
- [ ] Custom shaders compile and run successfully
- [ ] Logging system captures development events at various levels
- [ ] Clear documentation exists for extending the engine
- [ ] All example code runs without errors
- [ ] Developer has gained practical experience with C++, SDL3, and OpenGL

## Dependencies
- CMake 3.20+
- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 12+, MSVC 2019+)
- SDL3 (latest stable)
- OpenGL 3.3+ compatible graphics driver
- spdlog for logging
