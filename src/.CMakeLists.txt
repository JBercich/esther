# # CMakeLists
# # ---------- 

# # The application build process uses CMakeLists for constructing a build `makefile` and
# # simplify abstracting between application files, static libraries and packages used in
# # the application. A monolithic-styled project structure is used where all source file
# # subdirectories contain a manually written `CMakeLists.txt` file at the recommendation
# # of the developer.

# # Builds for the project should be performed in the `/build` subdirectory to prevent 
# # any build files within the application source. Application bundles will be created in
# # this subdirectory with any other bundling procedures. During builds, a configuration
# # file for static "absolute" data is created in the top-level `/include` subdirectory.

# # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
# # Project definition
# # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

# # This project will use a modern `cmake` version. The majority of any project based
# # logic for building out the project source will use the name given to the project to
# # make any future changes much easier by only changing this title. The project version
# # may fall out of sync in the future when using some form of CI distribution building
# # tool since this file should remain fairly unchanged.

# set(PROJECT_NAME        "Esther")

# # Using the latest CMP0076 policy allows the addition of sources for the target exec.
# # using target_sources within subdirectories after the definition of the executable.
# # Using the latest CMP0079 policy allows the addition of the simultaneously built 
# # engine static library to be added from a project subdirectory where it is defined at
# # its respective top-level `/src/Engine` subdirectory.

# # Testing framework
# # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

# # Generic CTest framework implementation is defined here. Although I have no experience
# # with CTest, it is my future goal to create a basic unit-testing suite which is very 
# # important considering how quickly this application is gaining breadth.

# # Package management
# # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

# # Packages should be installed manually within the build environment and using the
# # expected system locations for the `find_package` routines to work effectively. In the
# # future, path hints will be given if necessary, however this is a very low-level 
# # application with very few dependencies so this should not be required since only very
# # popular and well-maintained packages are used.

# find_package(SDL2         2.26.5  REQUIRED)
# find_package(SDL2_image   2.6.2   REQUIRED)
# find_package(SDL2_mixer   2.6.2   REQUIRED)
# find_package(SDL2_ttf     2.20.1  REQUIRED)
# find_package(spdlog       1.11.0  REQUIRED)

# # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
# # Executable target
# # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

# # A single application executable is built. App bundling is performed later on, however,
# # The inclusion of different packages such as `spdlog` is required here as a linked and
# # included library for use. Other packages such as `SDL2` will be used through a wrapepr
# # in the engine static library.

# add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} src/Main.cpp)

# target_include_directories(
#     ${PROJECT_NAME} 
#     PRIVATE
#         ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include

# )

# target_link_libraries(
#     ${PROJECT_NAME} 
#     PRIVATE 
#         spdlog::spdlog
# )

# # All remaining CMakeLists logic remains in the `/src` subdirectory which will contain
# # further documentation on the abstraction of the engine and game targets and how they
# # are built up recursively.

# add_subdirectory(src)

# # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
# # Compilation options
# # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

# # Changes to the compilation options are implemented below. This will be expanded in the
# # future to have additional compilation flags for each pre-processor dependent on OS of
# # the build and the build type to optimise for different build requirements.

# target_compile_options(
#     ${PROJECT_NAME}

# )

# # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
# # Exporing configuration data
# # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

# # A build configuration header file is generated with important information from the
# # build process to be available within the application itself such as package versions,
# # debugging flags, etc. The file is located in the `/include` subdirectory for both the
# # engine and game source files to use this information. In the future, the engine should
# # be initialised without referencing this file and take any required data from some
# # initialisation argument set.

# configure_file(
#     ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/BuildConfig.hpp.in 
#     ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/BuildConfig.hpp
# )

# # Application bundling
# # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

# # CPack bundling is shown below, however, for cross-platform builds there may be other
# # tools required such as creating a MacOS app bundle or a win32 QT application. The use
# # of CPack will likely change in the future.
