# Documentation

This project will use Doxygen for generating project wikis. For docstring documentation,
function headers and other important file descriptions will be given in the header file
for an easier lookup. The C++ files themselves contain documentation regarding intrinsic
function and class logic as well as more  details on the implementation. Additional
documentation will be given in this directory for high-level information that is still
relevant. These documentation files will also be given as Doxygen source markdowns for
easier access.
