# Documentation

This project will use Doxygen for generating project wikis from the repository. For
docstring documentation, function headers and other important file descriptions will be 
given in the header file for an easier lookup for code details. The C++ files themselves
contain documentation regarding intrinsic function and class logic as well as more 
details on the implementations. Additional documentation will be given in this directory 
for high-level information that is still relevant. These documentation files will also
be given as Doxygen source markdowns for easier access.
